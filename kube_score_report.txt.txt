        · gptcontainer -> CPU limit is not set
            Resource limits are recommended to avoid resource DDOS. Set
            resources.limits.cpu
        · gptcontainer -> Memory limit is not set
            Resource limits are recommended to avoid resource DDOS. Set
            resources.limits.memory
        · gptcontainer -> CPU request is not set
            Resource requests are recommended to make sure that the application
            can start and run without crashing. Set resources.requests.cpu
        · gptcontainer -> Memory request is not set

    [CRITICAL] Pod NetworkPolicy
        · The pod does not have a matching NetworkPolicy
            Create a NetworkPolicy that targets this pod to control who/what
            can communicate with this pod. Note, this feature needs to be
            supported by the CNI implementation used in the Kubernetes cluster
            to have an effect.
    [CRITICAL] Container Security Context User Group ID
        · gptcontainer -> Container has no configured security context

    [CRITICAL] Deployment has PodDisruptionBudget
        · No matching PodDisruptionBudget was found
            It's recommended to define a PodDisruptionBudget to avoid
            unexpected downtime during Kubernetes maintenance operations, such
            as when draining a node.
    [WARNING] Deployment has host PodAntiAffinity
        · Deployment does not have a host podAntiAffinity set
            It's recommended to set a podAntiAffinity that stops multiple pods
            from a deployment from being scheduled on the same node. This
            increases availability in case the node becomes unavailable.
